# Rosalind Solutions
This repository includes nice solutions for ROSALIND?
## What is ROSALIND?
In my words, ROSALIND is a coding platform where many biological challenges are awating to be solved programatically.
According to ROSALIND web-site(http://rosalind.info/about/), 'To make learning bioinformatics fun and easy, we have founded Rosalind, a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving'
## Why did I choose it?
I just did not enjoy solving problem on Hackerrank-like coding platforms. Since ROSALIND combines programming with biology and increases the consciousness about bioinformatics, I thought I would enjoy it.
