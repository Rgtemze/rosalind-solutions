# Rosalind Solutions
This repository includes nice solutions written in Python for ROSALIND.<br>New solutions will be uploaded on a daily basis.
## Who is Rosalind Franklin?
From Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin), Rosalind Elsie Franklin was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer who made contributions to the understanding of **the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite.** Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, **her contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely recognised posthumously.**
## What is ROSALIND?
In my words, ROSALIND is a coding platform where many biological challenges are awating to be solved programatically.
According to ROSALIND web-site(http://rosalind.info/about/), 'To make learning bioinformatics fun and easy, we have founded Rosalind, a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving'
## Why did I choose it?
I just did not enjoy solving problem on Hackerrank-like coding platforms. Since ROSALIND combines programming with biology and increases the consciousness about bioinformatics, I thought I would enjoy it.
